rainbowlinks.js by Michele
  
This is a JavaScript library for rainbow links.

When you hover any link (&lt;a&gt;) on the page it
shifts the hue of the link's color, but it keeps
the saturation and lightness. This way you can
initialize the link with any color!

The library is written so that it is as
optimized as possible and uses as few operations
as possible.
